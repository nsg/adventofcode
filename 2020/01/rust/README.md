# Rust

More or less the same looks from the bash implementation, just in Rust an a lot faster.
Probably horrible rust, i do not like all these clones ... I think I need to refresh me Rust understanding a little to fix that.

## Part 1

```
$ rustc part1.rs && time ./part1
123456

real    0m0,001s
user    0m0,001s
sys     0m0,000s

```

## Part 2

```
$ rustc part2.rs && time ./part2
12345678

real    0m0,027s
user    0m0,023s
sys     0m0,004s
```
